# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM
This project implements a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is designed to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. In this README, you'll find details about the project structure, usage instructions, and dependencies.

##Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an LSTM-based machine learning model that can predict the future closing prices of Indian stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The model is trained on historical stock data and utilizes deep learning techniques to capture temporal patterns and dependencies in the data.
