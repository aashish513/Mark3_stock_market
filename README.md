# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM
This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to implement a stock price prediction model. The model is designed to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. 
This project aims to develop an LSTM-based machine learning model that can predict the future closing prices of Indian stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The model is trained on historical stock data and utilizes deep learning techniques to capture temporal patterns and dependencies in the data.
